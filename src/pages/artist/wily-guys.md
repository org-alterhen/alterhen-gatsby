  sculptor/painter investigating the tension between looseness and exactitude as

title: WRONG, WRONG, WRONG
statement: >-
  This collection is part of an ongoing investigation into the artistic
  possibilities of error and uncertainty, as a way of mirroring the mysterious,
  counter-intuitive aspects of the quantum world.


  It is an attempt to accept a ‘failure’ of classical exactitude in aesthetics, as a way of gaining a deeper understanding of the human perception of the world, particularly as that perception modulates in extreme contexts.
