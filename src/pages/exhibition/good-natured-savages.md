  Patrick is a graphic designer and photographer from Iloilo. He shuttles
  between his hometown and Manila, where he works as a partner at Do Good
  Studio. 


  Over the last 15 years, he worked as an art director for various publications, published books and other print media under different publishing houses, and contributed photos to global magazines. 


  His book with the theme "nation-building starts in cities," published in collaboration with his studio and a local government office, won the Good Design award for print in 2019. 


  He pursues his artistic practice using different platforms, often combining traditional with new media. He uses animation, photography, and video—usually presented with type—to create new anecdotes exploring memory, communication, fiction, and the curiosities and imperfections of the process of documentation. When implementing humor in his work, he invites the viewer to engage and discover associations and differences to their own ideas and experiences. His current research takes inspiration from local history and culture. He deep-dives into online archives to collect records and images and uses them to allow history to cross formats through modern technology and his work. He becomes archivist and curator, exploring identity while investigating traditional missteps, their effects on contemporary referential semantics, and documenting them on the blockchain.

      "Every day in the week is receiving day with these good-natured savages."

      "To see the smallest people in the world and to observe the lowest order of human intellect World's Fair visitors in great numbers go to the Negrito Village of the Philippine Reservation. Negritos, little negroes, are the original inhabitants of the Philippine Islands. 

      They are barbarians. They have a kind of spirit worship, and all tribes give ceremonial dances. As a rule, they are headhunters. Probably no tribe in the Archipelago can produce such splendid specimens physically.

      The Igorot is one of the most conspicuous races of Northern Luzon. Scientists have declared that with the proper training they are susceptible to a high state of development and unlike the American Indian, will accept, rather than defy, the advance of American Civilization."

      "The most ambitious and advanced of the Igorot community are not above fascinations of the dance, nor can they resist the lifelong habit to appear without clothing. Antaero is far in advance of his people in his efforts to go the white man’s road. He not only speaks English but sings English songs. When the President of the United States asked him how it was that he spoke such good English he said it was because he went to the Filipino school at the World’s Fair every day. His ambition is to teach school when he becomes a man, but when asked if he would wear American clothes, he replied, “I like string breach.” This is the name Igorots apply to the cloud. The school to which Antaero referred is a most interesting educational exhibit."

      "The owners of the camera are informed by placards that they take snapshots in the Filipino village at their own risk. Antaero has acquired fearlessness of the Kodiak with his knowledge of the English language. He poses boldly. Some of his countrymen still cling to the prejudice against being photographed. Antaero’s proudest accomplishment is the singing of “My Country ’Tis of Thee.” He sings slowly and distinctly. When complimented he replies, “Sank Yoh."
