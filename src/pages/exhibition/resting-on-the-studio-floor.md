description: "In this exhibition, Tresset, following his series of Human Study
  #2 installations pursues his exploration of the Vanitas theme;  in contrast to
  the traditional Flemish manner, the atmosphere is stark rather than
  opulent.  Using GIFs as time-based media, these works are experiments in
  minimalist storytelling. "

Patrick Tresset is a Brussels-based artist who, in his work, explores human traits and the aspects of human experience. 

His work reflects recurrent ideas such as embodiment, passing time/time passing, childhood, conformism, obsessiveness, nervousness, the need for storytelling, and mark-making. He is best known for his performative installations using robotic agents as stylized actors that make marks and for his exploration of the drawing practice using computational systems and robots. 

He holds a master’s degree and then an MPhil in arts and computational technologies from Goldsmiths College London. 

Aside from his artistic practice, in 2013, he was a senior visiting research fellow at Konstanz University and is currently an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Canberra in the robotics department. 

His work has been exhibited in solo and group shows, including in association with major museums such as; The Pompidou Center (Paris), Prada Foundation (Milan), Tate Modern (London), V&A, MMCA (Seoul), The Grand Palais (Paris), BOZAR (Brussels), TAM (Beijing), Mcam (Shanghai), Mori Museum (Tokyo).
