  14 sec towards carbon neutrality or the point of no return 


  With this new series, Diane Drubay plays with color psychology to create an immersion that is both fascinating and shattering. She takes the viewer into an idealized vision of a world where interference colors cover the sky, creating a subjugating sense of calm. In this piece, seconds become years. Gradually this mesmerizing world is being transformed into a darker, but equally fascinating vision. 14 seconds to experience the metamorphosis of utopia into dystopia. 14 years to reach carbon neutrality or the point of no return.


  Her speculative visions are drawn by the aesthetics of social science fiction literature and current climate science discoveries. She advocates for optimistic images interpreting shocking stories of possible futures.

  Diane Drubay is a visual artist working with photographs and videos to create
  anticipatory visions of other futures. Her creations are drawn by the
  aesthetics of social science fiction literature, using colour psychology and
  current scientific discoveries. The speculative visions depicted by Diane
  Drubay advocate for optimistic images interpreting shocking stories of
  possible futures. 


  Diane Drubay's fascination with natural light and colors started in 2012 while waiting for the golden hour in the garden of Claude Monet at Giverny. There, she captured the awakening of Nature and its changes over the months (she produced or supervised the series of videos 'Monet's Secret Garden'). Between 2013 and 2018, she has been working on one project tracing the different stages to reach the ultimate transcendence through Nature by compiling hundreds of impressions of the rising and setting sun. This led to a final 23-minute video untitled "Odyssey" and a great number of single videos and photographs. Since 2019, she is exploring natural glitches and how they impact our vision of landscapes and our imagination of the future.


  She found inspiration during her art residencies in the Creative Center of Stöðvarfjörður in Iceland, the Berlin Art Institute in Germany, and the Nida Art Colony in Lithuania.


  Her work has been shown at the Inter/Intra Human Exhibition by Factory Berlin, TRESOR Berlin, Bacalart Festival in Mexico, Galerie Dièse 22 in Paris, Gothenburg Art Sound Festival in Sweden, DAT Festival in Berlin, Alte Münze in Berlin, SPEKTRUM Berlin.
