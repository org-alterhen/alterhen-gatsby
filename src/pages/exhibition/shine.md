  David Pettersson, also known as SOMATIC BITS, is a digital artist working on
  interactive, immersive and generative artworks. A graphic designer turned
  creative coder, his works are trying to touch the psyche of the viewer.
  Immersing and engulfing anyone willing to get swept away into a world of his
  own. Making the reality twist around, and leave a permanent trace upon the
  mind of whoever sees his pieces. 


  From simplistic monochrome to hyper-detailed colourful artworks, he never stops trying to find ways to express his vision of life and has a constant flow of ideas and creativity. Life is made for experimenting - and it transpires into his creations.
