summary: Reflecting the diversity of artists in the NFT scene, Exhibition II is
  the new show presented by the members of alterHEN. For this occasion, the
  artists have experimented with new collaborations.
description: Offering a variety of formats, Exhibition II is an opportunity for
  alterHEN artists to experiment in two different ways. Some artists tried
  machine learning generated images, others tested 3D scans or even the
  combination of movie soundtrack with gif animation. The big challenge of this
  exhibition was around collaboration where Bjorn Calleja invited Dennis Bato to
  co-create a series of paintings mixing their artistic practices with
  brilliance. This collaboration has been facilitated by mono8 gallery.
